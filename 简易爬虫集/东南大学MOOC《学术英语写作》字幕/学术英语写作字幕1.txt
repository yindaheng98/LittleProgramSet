﻿ People use different languages in different settings for different purposes If you are a student the language you use to chat with your girlfriend is very likely to be different from the text message you send to your teacher yo sup       Readin What ya readin' bout Dear professor Adams I 'm texting you to ask for a sick leave for your class of next week I was just diagnosed as having flu which is contagious Can I have your PowerPoint to make it up Thank you very much for your understanding Yours truly   James You see the difference  In this class we are going to talk about language register What is register What are the different registers in English What are the linguistic features of academic register And finally we ll have a little practice Language register is a style of speaking and writing depending on the audience purpose topic and location It also represents a level of language formality in spoken and written languages There are languages registers in English Static  or frozen formal  or regulated consultative also called professional and academic casual  in other words group register the last register is personal or intimate Static or frozen language does not change For example  the U.S. constitution wedding oath class pledge Formal language is a one-way communication and impersonal Interruptions are not allowed For example class lectures  speeches announcements Consultative or professional or academic language is a formal conversation focused on providing information For example that used between employee and boss or student and teacher Causal language is informal It uses slang and idioms It's considered "group language " because you have to be a part of the accepted group to use this language e.g.  you will hear it between friends or read it in text messages "Yo  sup " or "Nah" "LOL" are all casual language teenagers are experts at casual language Intimate language is for private conversation in a close relationship e.g. a parent and a child siblings or boyfriend and girlfriend The language we use in academic writing is mainly formal language But what are the differences between informal and formal English Let's have a look at two different registers of passages for and think about what features make the language formal This is register Here we are  register You may find it pretty difficult to understand the second style of writing because there are some features of formal register which make the writing quite different than the first passage First these vocabulary words in red are medical terms You may need background knowledge to understand them The orange words represent present tense because the passage comes from a medical textbook and states some facts The pink ones represent a passive voice which is very frequently seen in academic register because there is no need to tell who the agent or the doer is but just state how things are done The purple word DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acronym which is very likely to be known only within the medical field The green words are nominalization which means verbs are transformed into nouns to increase the formality level The brown word "it" is a third person pronouns In academic writing third person pronouns or a non-person subjects are very frequently used to create a sense of  objectivity You will note that the sentences in passage are longer and more complex than in the first passage Let's have a little practice Please rewrite the following sentence in formal language Usually you won't get hurt if you don't fool around "Won't" is a contraction "fool around" is an idiomatic phrase "get hurt" is informal We can change these words to make the sentence  more academic "Usually" is replaced by "in most cases" the second person pronoun is replaced with a third person individual  he or she "Get hurt" is changed to "be injured" "fool around" to "careful" We change all casual words to formal ones So the sentence is In most cases an individual will not be injured when he or she is careful To wrap up formations or characteristics of academic register include wording terminology  hyponyms and acronym nominalization  third person pronouns the  statement impersonalized the passive voice and present tense in statement of facts its  well important to remember that form reading of  Higher structural complexity than that in general English Thank you .

﻿ Hi good morning everyone Today we are going to talk about how to write a title for an academic paper First of all Let's have a look at these titles Would you read the papers judging from the titles Or are these titles attractive enough to invite you to spend minutes or more to go through the main body Probably not Why not   First these four titles are all too general we have no idea what they are about Second let's look at the first one "the U.S.constitution"sounds a little boring unless politics is your specialty "The history of the tennis ball" is a little trivial and it is hard to develop it into a 10-page essay "Life of U.S. president Kennedy" is very likely to be based on single resource a biography  for example And "death penalty" is an overused topic that has been written on too much already So these titles are not what we want The above are just examples of bad titles When you choose your topic Do remember to avoid the above types of topics The first type of topic you should avoid is a topic that has too wide a scope If you check your OPAC system at the library or search the topic online and find that lots of books and articles have been written about your topic then it is probably too big A topic with too wide a scope is not researchable The second type that should be avoided is one that is too trivial People sometimes go to the extremities Just like too big a topic too trivial a topic is not researchable either Sometimes the topic is trivial  because it is obvious like "walking is a good aerobic exercise" The safest way is to ask your tutor about it The third type of topic that should be avoided is that based on a single resource The research paper is intended to expose you to different opinions of different people If the topic is mainly based on one resource you are defeating the purpose of the paper If you d like to write about the life of a famous person it is very likely that you will over-rely on a single resource The fourth type of title that should be avoided is the type that has been overused There are some topics that we are very familiar with so that it is relatively hard to produce something new These topics are abortion teenage marriage substance abuse global warming the death penalty if you have to write about an overused topic try to approach it from a new angle to produce sth new and to distinguish yourself from the familiar cliché We have learnt what bad titles look like then  what makes a good title There are several principles to observe which can be simplified as SCI It is not what we know about the publication level i.e.  "Science Citation Index" Here S stands for specific which means the title cannot be too broad or general Because too general a topic is not researchable For example "bilingualism" is too big to be covered in an essay of pages and you can develop over or smaller researchable topics as undergraduate students C stands for concise It means a title preferably contains as few words as possible usually in noun phrases So try to be concise and short "I" stands for "informative" It means the title should contain all key words of the research objective In this way the title can provide adequate information about the research and the readers can make a quick decision whether they would read the whole paper just at the sight of the title If some key words are missing or some non-key words appear in the title it would be misleading It would be a frustrating experience for readers to find the essay is not what it looks like So all in all a good title should be specific concise and informative This is what we called an "SCI" title Let's have a little practice to test ourselves on what we have learnt Here we have two groups of titles Decide which is an "SCI"  title The first group An investigation of mast cell functioning The role of mast cells in inflammation We know that mast cells have many functions They play a role in inflammation in allergy and in cancer so it can be narrowed down to a specific disease which can make sure the essay is limited to a reasonable length Obviously  the second one is much more specific than the first one Let's see the second group Major California labor laws and their impact on Mexican migrant workers California migrant workers "California migrant workers" is shorter but is pretty big If you would like to write about a specific person or a group of people usually they have many aspects to write about like their political aspect their economic aspect their education their marriage life and etc Please just choose one Here the author of title narrowed the migrant worker to Mexicans He is a law student and relates the topic to his specialty So the first one is much more specific We already know what an SCI title is but how can we write an S.C.I. title on our own Here I'd like to provide you a "3-step" method to write your own title The first step is to choose a topic Pick a topic you really like are curious about or are an expert on You are like a traveller who is choosing where to go If it's some place you like you'll enjoy getting there But if it turns out to be somewhere you don't like getting there would be a misery for you So make sure this topic is interesting to you The second step is to narrow the topic down to a researchable one by adding some determiners or modifiers to the topic word you have chosen Remember  the more determiners you have the more specific the title is A reasonably specific title should be covered in about pages Step is paraphrasing Usually your narrowed down topic is a viewpoint a statement or a research question try to paraphrase whatever you have into a noun phrase of less than words You may know a lot of essay titles which are not noun phrases but noun phrases are the safest option for beginner writers When you choose your topic it could be a contemporary one like fighting obesity in children and teenagers or how modern online slang affects society The topic can also be a more historical one like the effect of religion on American politics how English is used in advertising in china Now let's test ourselves on the 3- step method to write a title You are interested in china But china is as big as it is What can we do about it You have to narrow it down by adding some determiners Here we are Chinese agriculture is more specific than china But it is not enough You can further narrow it down by adding a time period and relate it to your specialty say politics Here we are The effect on China of its agricultural policies during the past years is a good option Here is another example Anxiety is a heated issue nowadays drawing attention of many psychologists and educators But it is also too big What can we do Right Add a determiner to the word Then we have student anxiety Obviously  we have sth more to do We can further narrow it down by limiting anxiety to some aspects of the issue and by specifying the research population Here we go The major types and levels of anxiety of the graduate students of Southeast University is absolutely an SCI title In summary  we have learned what a good title should be like and a 3-step method to write your own title I hope you can write a perfect title for your essay after watching this video Thank you for watching Have a nice day .

﻿ Hello  In this short video we are going to talk about nominalization a very important technique in academic writing Here are the main items covered in this video What is nominalization Why do we have to use it And how do we use it What is nominalization Nominalization is the process of converting verbs or adjectives in a sentence to nouns The purposes of nominalization are to Increase information density and facilitate efficiency and accuracy of communication Express abstract concepts e.g.  revolution possibility Hide the agent behind an action Improve flow of writing maintain connections between ideas Make writing more "written" and professional But how to nominalize a sentence First Write a simple sentence Then choose an appropriate ending to create a nominalized form for the main verb or adjective Next find a second verb to be the main verb The last step is to fill in the sentence with additional information So the nominalization formula can be illustrated in the following flow chart Here is an example to show the steps of nominalization Princess Shotoko admired china Can you transform this sentence into another one with nominalizations First  we choose the only verb admire nominalize it to be a subject And add an appropriate suffix to turn it into admiration Then the sentence becomes a noun phrase Admiration of china Next  a new verb should be added Here we take "bring" as a verb The last step is to fill in the rest of the information Here we are Admiration of china brought religious and scholarly ideas to Japan in the 7th century Let's have a little practice Please rewrite the following sentence with nominalizations If we contain the problem we can reduce the effect Here we choose two verbs contain and reduce and transform them with appropriate suffixes into nouns So  "Contain the problem " becomes the containment of the problem "Reduce the effect " is changed to a reduction of the effect Then we need to find a new verb to connect the two ideas This sentence would be like this The containment of the problems will lead to a reduction of the effect To wrap up Nominalization is to convert verbs/adjectives to nouns Nominalization is an important technique for academic writing We learnt a 4-step procedure to transform an informal sentence into a formal/academic one Thank you .

﻿ If you want to persuade others your language must be strong and clear When you state your opinions you want to refer to the evidence instead of what you think The correct choice of personal pronouns will improve the creditability and professionality of your statement and help you achieve these communicative goals Hello today we are going to talk about personal pronouns and academic writing This mini-lecture will be divided into parts First  we'll have a little review about all personal pronouns in English And then why  we need to avoid first and second person pronouns Next How to avoid first and second person pronouns Before we finish for the day we will clarify  some confusions If we look at the table horizontally we can see first second and third person pronouns And if we look at it vertically we can see the middle column is singular form and the right plural form Formal and academic writing needs to be impersonal as statements of opinions in a paper are supposed to be independent of individual perspective And an academic essay should be scientific and sound distanced Such first and second person pronouns as "I" and "you" are not objective so generally they should be avoided But we cannot say "I" and "we" should be totally avoided because different disciplines have different tolerances for the first person pronoun In some disciplines  the use of "I" is perceived as being too personal However  people are more tolerant of such uses in other disciplines So you should be aware of the preference of the discipline  you are in In general such third person pronouns as  "it" and "they" sound more objective and convincing so it's safer to use third person pronouns in academic writing But how can we avoid using first person pronouns in a sentence Here are some examples I  think that the results show In my opinion the results show I  believe that the results show In these sentences the author is announcing their findings But as we all know any opinion or finding without a reference in the paper is the author's so there is no need to make the announcement that it's the authors findings In this case I think  in my opinion and I believe can just be deleted without harming the function of these sentences The second way to avoid first person pronouns is to change the active voice to the passive voice For example In this paper we developed a feasible transmission schedule If "we" is deleted there would be no agent so the passive voice is the best choice Then the sentence would be In this paper a feasible transmission schedule was developed Let's have a little practice The original sentence is As I observed the communication styles of first-year Carolina women I noticed frequent use of non-verbal cues The writer is stating the finding of his observation frequent use of non-verbal cue so just state it "I observed" is the research approach You want to highlight the finding instead of the approach So the original sentence could be revised to A study of the communication styles of first-year Carolina women revealed frequent use of non-verbal cues We can see avoiding the first person creates the desired impression of an observed phenomenon that could be reproduced and also creates a stronger clearer statement Let's come to the second person pronoun Remember  do not use second person in the paper unless you give instructions Here are some examples of revisions It is important that you examine could be revised to It is important to examine You should examine this could be an imperative sentence Examine    you can just change a subject like... The user should examine You can see from the results in figure This sentence  describes the findings in the figure So just state what is presented in the figure As shown in figure or use passive voice like As can be seen in figure Compared with the first and second person the third person sounds credible assertive and professional So they're widely used in creative and academic writing There 's one thing I have to remind you That is  when you use the third person please use gender fair language First  avoid automatic use of masculine pronouns such as "he" and "his" when referring to a singular noun for example    A student will do better if he has a voice in the decision It would be fairer to say A student will do better if he or she has a voice in the decision But too much "He or she" will sound redundant so the plural form may be a better option E.g. students will do better if they have a voice in the decision There is another example I'd like to clarify Here is the sentence pattern It has been found that It was found that are very frequently used in an essay But the problem is who has found it is unclear I suggest if it is the finding of several studies just write "several studies have found that" If it's found by one study you can write "Kroll found that " if the information is from your study you can say "we found that " I found that If it's not acceptable to use the first person in your field you can use the code word this study   the current study the present study  this author In summary first and second person pronouns sound personal and subjective Third person pronouns are academic and professional Thank you for watching
