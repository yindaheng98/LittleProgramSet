﻿ Hello  everyone After reviewing the literature the author will provide the information about the methods applied in the current research and the results obtained from different experiments or surveys But how do we write the method section and how do we report the results Now I'll explain them one by one Hi  everyone Can you tell me which section is the most important section in a research paper Yes  it is the method section Now let me tell you why and then talk about some points as to the writing of this section In a research paper the method section is considered the most important section because it provides the information by which the validity and credibility of a study can ultimately be judged Therefore  the researcher must provide a clear and precise description of how an experiment was carried out and the rationale for the specific experimental procedures chosen The following aspects are related to the writing of the method section In natural sciences the method section is often called Materials and Methods In social science it is common to introduce a section called Theory and Methods Sometimes  it is divided into two sections Theoretical Framework and Methods Generally speaking the method section mainly describes the steps that you followed in conducting your study and the materials you used in each step The elements included in the method section and the order in which they are presented may differ from department to department Here we would like to introduce some elements which are typical and representative in most disciplines Overview of the experiment When you overview the experiment you need to  use one sentence briefly telling what was done The sentence is like a topic sentence Population The population refers to the people subjects studied or the things tested in the study Location In the method section you should mention the place where the study took place Restriction or Limiting conditions Restriction or Limiting conditions refer to the precautions taken to make sure that the data are valid Sampling Techniques Here you should describe how the subjects or participants were selected for the study Materials Also  the materials which were used to conduct the study or experiment should be described Procedures Of course it is very important to state the procedures or the steps of the experiment in a chronological order Statistical Treatment And at last you need to describe how the statistics were examined It is worth noticing that not all the items are included in all disciplines because various disciplines have various procedures or regulations In some disciplines the method section is called the Methodology Section When the author uses "Methodology" as the title of the section he or she needs to provide the rationales for how the experiment was designed and  conducted for the current study The rationales refer to the fundamental reasons or principles of doing things In such a case the author should offer some reasons for designing or conducting the experiments or surveys For example the reasons for such questions as why did the author choose such participants and "Why did the study follow such procedures " should be offered If the researcher conducted his/her experiments by following the methods used by others he/she should acknowledge those authors/researchers in order to avoid plagiarism In this sense the author should be very familiar with the theories and principles of designing and conducting experiments At the same time the author needs to avoid plagiarism by referencing well Since the method section is very important we need to pay more attention to the major elements and use of language when we write this section Thanks for watching .

﻿ In the previous lecture I mentioned the importance of the method section Actually the results section is also important because it presents the answers to the research questions which the readers are curious about Now  I'd like to talk about some points which should be stressed when you write the results section When you report the results the following elements may be included The statement showing where the results can be found The statement presenting the most important findings The statement commenting on the results this may include The generalisation from the results The possible explanations of the possible reasons for the results The comparison of the results with what was expected or with results from other studies These elements can be found in the results section in most journal papers The results section is usually presented both in diagrams and texts No matter how professional the diagrams are the texts are the most important way to present the results So authors need to use very academic and smooth language to report the results compare the data and make explanations and comments When reporting the results the author should decide how to order the results The order should be in accordance with the order of the research questions or research methods The arrangement of the order should abide by the normal practice of the target journal or the specific discipline The language focus of the results section will include how to use sequential markers how to describe the graphs and how to compare and contrast which will be explained in the lectures followed When you write the results section you need to pay attention to the major elements the presentation of the results the order of the results and language focus But if you want to write this section well you still need to read more journal papers about the structure of this section Thanks for watching .

﻿ Sequence markers in English writing are a certain group of items that link sentences together into a larger unit of discourse These linguistic items go by various names such as conjuncts sentence adverbials connectives linking devices transitional words and phrases But why do we use sequential markers and what are the commonly used sequential markers Let me show you the answers in this micro lecture Sequential markers can help establish clear connections between ideas and ensure that sentences and paragraphs flow together smoothly making them easier to read In writing the method section the author needs to describe the procedures very clearly and logically In such a situation the author prefers to write process paragraphs to explain how to do things and how something works These process paragraphs are usually developed step by step in a chronological or logical sequence The following sequential expressions are more frequently used to link steps in a description of a process or to divide a process into steps Here is a paragraph in which the author uses various sequential markers From the example we can see this paragraph is naturally and cohesively presented because the author uses various sequential markers in describing the procedures flexibly Actually sequential markers can appear in any part of a research paper especially in the method section where you need to provide the information about the procedures of conducting the study With the help of sequential markers you can make your papers more logical and coherent I hope you could use the sequential markers correctly and properly in your writing Thanks for watching

﻿ Hi everyone Can you think of any devices which can present the results more vivid Right  you can use graphs Graphs are commonly used in reporting the results of your research A graph is a diagram usually a line or a curve which shows how two or more sets of numbers and measurements are related Graphs usually include bar charts pie charts line graphs and so on
Graphs usually include bar charts pie charts line graphs and so on The results section is usually presented both in graph and text First  prepare the graphs as soon as all the data are analyzed and arrange them in the sequence that best presents your results in a logical way Then as the results section is a text-based section the description of graphs is of great importance in paper writing Good descriptions can help the readers understand your research better while using a single sentence pattern to describe the statistical and graphic information in a research paper will make your readers feel too bored and lose interest in reading on so we need to pay more attention to the language used when describing the statistical and graphic information The description of graphs is of great importance in paper writing because it can help the readers understand your research better How do you describe a graph Here are the major steps for you to follow Step Introduce the graphic information briefly and indicate the main trend Normally  it includes the place time content and purpose of the graph Step  Describe the relevant and most important or significant data and make some comparison if necessary Words and expressions for describing a curve or a trend are very useful in presenting graphic information Step  Summarize the data/trends Here we introduce some useful words phrases or sentence patterns which can be used in different situations of graphic description If you need to highlight significant data in a table/chart you may use some adjectives such as apparent clear  interesting  obvious revealing  or  significant to make your viewpoint known and meanwhile to attract readers attention For example This micro lecture mainly talks about the use of graphs and the graphic description Remember the descriptions should be very close to the graphs you describe and the graphs described should be numbered for the convenience of the readers Thanks for watching .

﻿ When you are writing the results section you need to do much more than just give data What you should always try to do is to convey more information with the data Now let me introduce a way to deal with the data comparison and contrast Strictly speaking the purpose of comparison is to show similarities while contrast is used to show differences Through comparison or contrast between two or more things the readers can understand different things better Here are some key words commonly used to express comparison or contrast There are two ways of organizing paragraphs of comparison and contrast One way is to examine one thing thoroughly and then examine the other This method is called block comparison or block contrast The other way is to examine two things at the same time discussing them point by point This method is called alternating comparison or alternating contrast More examples can be obtained by reading more sample journal papers Comparison and contrast is often used in graph description Here are some points for you to pay special attention to Not all the information has to be compared or contrasted with each other It is common to introduce the most significant or important information and compare or contrast it If necessary you must make some calculation before comparing or contrasting the data When comparing or contrasting information in the graphs it is not necessary to lay equal emphasis on every change Just give stress to those dramatic changes or to those that are of special interest to you or those that you want your readers to pay more attention to and ignore the less important parts The comparison and contrast should be supported by concrete and relevant facts or data To make the data you collected more meaningful you need to make comparison or contrast So it's very good for you to grasp the skills I introduced in the micro lecture Thanks for watching This unit introduces two important sections in an academic article the method section and the results section Both of them have their features in the elements and language use I hope this micro-lecture could help you learn how to write these two sections with the language focuses I introduced before Thanks for watching
