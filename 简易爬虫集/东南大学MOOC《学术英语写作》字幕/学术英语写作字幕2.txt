Now you need to write a literature review
Whether this is a class assignment
a thesis for your masters' degree
or the foundation
for your doctoral dissertation
you are doing it for the same reason
to lay a solid foundation by
critically reviewing previous work and
find a space to develop your own research
Doing this right can largely increase your skills
knowledge and expertise in this field
Hello  I'm  Doctor Wu
There are known
procedures and skills you can use
to make your task easier
and more efficient
In this online class
we'll provide you a roadmap
to produce a literature review
that will contribute to your field
We'll talk about three questions
What is a Literature Review
Are there different types of it
How do we review literature
Now let's start with the question
What is a Literature Review
A literature review
is a careful examination of a body of literature
pointing toward the answer
to your research question
It provides the context
and the background
about the current knowledge of the topic
and establishes a convincing thesis
to answer the study's question
So what is not a literature review
A literature review is not just
an annotated bibliography
a book report or a "data dump"
where you simply gather
all of the information you have acquired
and randomly or awkwardly transfer it
to paper without rhyme or reason
It is an argument
that presents a case
based on a comprehensive understanding
of the current state of knowledge
about a topic of study
Thus it's necessary to
include a critical analysis of the different opinions
from credible sources and point out
how they are related to your own thesis statement
Are there different types of literature review
Yes  There are simple and complex models
A simple literature review gathers
documents analyses
and draws conclusions
about what is known of the topic
Its purpose is to produce a proposition
that reflects the current understanding
about the research question
A simple literature review begins by
Selecting and identifying
a research interest for inquiry
This is called the preliminary study question
As you proceed
you narrow and refine this interest
into a research topic
based on an initial exploration of the literature
The research topic is a clear and concise statement
that defines and describes
what will be researched
Its definition identifies and
frames the scope of the literature review
The literature review discusses the literature
documenting and cataloguing pertinent knowledge
From this information
it presents an evidence-based analysis
of the present understanding of the topic
The product of the simple literature review
is the development of a case
that argues what is known about the topic
The case's conclusion
the thesis statement
answers the question posed
by the research interest
Many class research assignments
and master's degree thesis projects
require a simple literature review
A complex literature review on the other hand
has a different purpose
and additional demands
It not only presents the current
state of knowledge about a topic
but it also argues
how this knowledge reasonably leads
to a problem
or to a question requiring original research
It is often adopted
when you need to write
your doctoral dissertation or
publish your work in prestigious journals
Before writing a literature review
you have to first review
the relevant research papers and books
How do we do that
Doing  a Literature Review is scholarly exerise
employing an applied critical thinking process
Doing  a Literature Review is scholarly exerise
employing an applied critical thinking process
Conducting a literature review is developmental
with each of the six steps leading to the next
Here is a brief explanation of these six steps
A successful research topic
usually begins with a compelling interest
about a problem
whether it comes from the field
or from previous research
This topic must be stated
as a well-defined question
accessible  to a specific academic discipline
When the interest is field-based
refinements most likely must be made
to form it into a well-defined question
That interest must be translated from
everyday language into the concepts
and wording
that define a researchable topic
Three steps are taken to reach this transformation
Specifying the language
refining the focus of the interest
and selecting the academic vantage point
To argue your thesis successfully
you first need to present your case
To present your case
you also need to organize the relevant data
into a body of evidence
that explains what is known about the topic
A literature search determines
what information will be in the review
It does this by sifting the information
to only the data
that provides the strongest evidence
to support the thesis
When searching the literature
you must preview  select
and organize the data for study
Use the skills of skimming
scanning and mapping the data
The literature survey assembles
synthesizes and analyzes the data to
form the argument
about the current knowledge on the topic
The evidence creates a logical
and defensible set of conclusions or claims
These conclusions
provide the basis
for addressing the research question
The literature critique interprets
the current understanding of the topic
It analyzes how previous knowledge
answers  the research question
Thesis writing transforms the research project
into a written document
Through composing  molding  and refining
the written literature review
becomes a work
that accurately conveys the research
and that can be understood
by the intended audience
Thesis writing requires
writing auditing  and editing
Repeated editing creates the polished
final composition
Sounds a little daunting
Here are a few tips for you
Study carefully the literature review models
Choose one that suits you
Memorize it if possible
Use this flow chart to keep yourself on track
Collect evaluate and select literature
A good literature review should be an
effective evaluation of selected documents
on a research topic
A good literature review should be an
effective evaluation of selected documents
on a research topic
Start writing now  As you read
you should also begin the writing process
—take notes
that you can later incorporate into the text
of your literature review
It is important to keep track of your sources
with citations to avoid plagiarism
Find connections and themes
To begin organizing your literature  review's
argument and structure
you need to identify relationships
between the sources you've read
Based on your reading and notes
you can look for trends
patterns conflicts or gaps
Well  that's all for Today's class
In the next class
we'll talk about
how to structure a literature review

Hi  everyone
Today we'll continue with Literature review
In the previous session
we've discussed
what is a literature review
and how to review literature
now it's time to learn how to write it
In this session
we shall analyze the structures
and explore the techniques of writing a good one
We'll talk about three questions
What should we include in a literature review
How can we organize these ideas
Are there any techniques that can be helpful
First question
What should we include in a Literature Review
Literature review is often at the very beginning
or the introduction part of a research paper
It can be written as a stand-alone section
or provide a theoretical framework
and rational for a research study
as part of the introduction section
A Literature Review
generally answers the following questions
and generally in the following order
You can use the answers to these questions
to structure your Literature Review
What are the seminal works on my topic
Do I need to mention these
What progress has been made
since these seminal works
What are the most relevant recent works
What is the best order to mention these works
What are the achievements
and limitations of these recent works
What gap do these limitations reveal
How does my work intend to fill this gap
Second question
How should we organize these ideas
There are various approaches
to organizing  the body of a literature review
You should have a rough idea
of your strategy before you start writing
Depending on the length of your literature review
you can combine several of these strategies
for example
your overall structure might be thematic
but each theme is discussed chronologically
Chronological
The simplest approach
is to trace the development
of the topic over time
However  if you choose this strategy
be careful to avoid simply listing
and summarizing sources in order
Try to analyze patterns
turning points and key debates
that have shaped the direction of the field
Give your interpretation of
how and why certain developments occurred
Thematic
If you have found some recurring central themes
you can organize your literature review
into subsections
that address different aspects of the topic
For example
if you are reviewing literature about
inequalities in migrant health outcomes
key themes might include
healthcare policy language barriers...
cultural attitudes  legal status  and economic access
Methodological
If you draw your sources
from different disciplines or fields
that use a variety of research methods
you might want to
compare the results and conclusions
that emerge from different approaches
For example
Look at what results have emerged
in qualitative versus  quantitative research
Discuss how the topic has been approached
by empirical versus theoretical scholarship
Divide the literature into sociological
historical and cultural sources
Theoretical
A literature review is often the foundation
for a theoretical framework
You can use it to discuss various theories
models and definitions of key concepts
You might argue for the relevance
of a specific theoretical approach
or combine various theoretical concepts
to create a framework for your research
Are there any techniques we can employ
How can we lead readers
to our own research
Here is an extract from the Introduction
to a paper entitled
The Effects of Feedback
and Attribution Style on Task Persistence
where a psychology student
Chris begins his review of the literature
Read the passage for minutes and find out
what are included in these paragraphs
Now let's look at the first paraph
The first sentence
of the first paragraph introduces
the main topic
cultural differences
and the rest of the paragraph briefly reviews
a major study on this topic
The implications of this study
culture as the remaining variable
are summarized at the end of the paragraph
The first sentence of the second paragraph
then moves on to the next
in chronological terms
major study
Chris summarizes Heine's work in a way that
involves the reader
he uses the verb speculated
and then continues the next sentence
using if
which gives an example of this speculation
The first sentence of the third paragraph
summarizes the findings
of the first two paragraphs
in order to introduce some more recent findings
Note also his use of tenses
In his first sentence
which is a very general overview
he uses the present perfect
Then when he talks about
the work of specific authors
and makes a summary of each step
in the chronology of the literature
he uses the past simple
Chris's structure is thus
introduction to topic
support from the literature
mini summary
introduction to next topic
This technique works very well
because it tells a story
it is a logical build up
to the reason behind Chris's investigation
that readers can easily follow
Chris has gradually prepared his readers
for the focus of his work
his own personal hypothesis regarding persistence
Ok  today we've talked about
what should be included in our review writing
how should we organize them
and a few techniques we could employ in writing

Hi everyone
Today we are going to talk about
the issues of plagiarism
and how to avoid it
Plagiarism is rightly
an important issue
in the academic world and beyond
It is basically "academic theft"
of words or ideas
an unethical practice
which can have very serious consequences
Here is what we are about to elaborate
Firstly we'll discuss
what is plagiarism
and different types of plagiarism
Then we'll proceed to find out
how to avoid it by citing properly
There are different citation styles
and methods in citing
Last but not the least
strategies for citing will also be explored
So  first
what is plagiarism according to
different sources
It is defined as
the copying or paraphrasing of
other people's work or ideas
into your own work
without full acknowledgement
the act of representing
as one's own original work
the creative works of another
without appropriate acknowledgment
of the author or source
the "wrongful appropriation" and
"stealing and publication" of another author's
language thoughts ideas or expressions
and the representation of them
as one's own original work
In a word
if no credit is given to the original source
even if you've made minor modifications
it could still be considered as plagiarism
Now let's decide whether the following cases
are examples of plagiarism
If you go through the four-step process
for paraphrasing
you would first translate the words
then flip the sentence structure
add a signal phrase and then cite
Therefore to avoid plagiarism
and conform to academic ethics
you need to check for plagiarism
before submitting your paper
provide reference to
every citation you make
and write in your own words
Using your own words
is especially important
when you cite other's work
Here are three techniques
you may employ when citing
When referring to the work of others you might
paraphrase  i.e. explain something
with roughly the same amount of detail
summarise  i.e. convey the main ideas of a passage
chapter article or book in fewer words
quote  i.e. use somebody else's exact words
relatively infrequent in scientiﬁc texts
though sometimes useful
especially for precise deﬁnitions
It is important to know
which technique is appropriate
It is also important to make sure that
the work you produce in this way
reﬂects your own understanding
and analysis of the subject
and of the sources you have consulted
Quoting is to repeat in speech
or writing the words of another person
esp. a powerful or important person
usu. with acknowledgement of the source
It is used when
language is particularly vivid or expressive
exact wording is needed for technical accuracy
the words of an important authority lend weight
to an argument
Paraphrasing
is to express the meaning of a word phrase
or passage in other words
usu. with the object of fuller
and clearer exposition so as to bring out the sense
We could change the original sentences
in both the lexical and syntactic level
Use synonyms
Change word forms
Make necessary structural adjustments
Change between
the affirmative and the negative
Change the voice from active to passive
Change clauses to phrases
Include reference to the original source
Summarizing is to put in your own words
a shortened version of written
or spoken material
stating the main points
and leaving out anything
that is not essential
Summarizing involves analyzing information
distinguishing important elements from
unimportant elements
and transforming large chunks of information
into a few short cohesive sentences
You can start by reading a short text
and highlight the main points
as you read
Reread the text
and make notes of the main points
leaving out examples  evidence  etc
Restate or repeat the ideas of the source
in different words and phrases
Do not add your own ideas
opinions or judgment of the arguments
Make it shorter than the source
We'll further explain them later
in the following classes
Thank you for watching

Reporting verbs
In academic writing
you will often need to refer
to the research of others
also called secondary sources
A reporting verb is a word
which is used to talk about
or report on other people's work
Reporting verbs can be used to great effect
but the difficulty with using them is that
there are many
and each of them has a slightly different
and often subtle meaning
In academic writing
it is important to present
an argument logically and cohesively
You may be required to
comment on someone's work
agree or disagree with someone else's study
evaluate someone's ideas
Often you will be assessed
on your ability to demonstrate these skills
It is repetitive and boring
to write ‘Smith says...’ over and over again
Fortunately
there is a wide choice
of reporting verbs in English
Reporting verbs can indicate either
(a) the author's personal viewpoint
(b) the author's viewpoint
regarding other literature
(c) your viewpoint regarding
what the author says
To interpret the writer's ideas
accurately however
you will need to use a verb
with the correct nuance
Use an English learner's dictionary to check
that you have the right verb
for the right context
Let's look at the following examples
Kon suggests that
all poets are strongly influenced
by their childhood
Patel  argues  that
governments should continue to
fund space projects
Greenberg claims   asserts contends
maintains  declares
that the causes of the revolution
can be traced back to the 18th century
You may notice that
these reporting verbs are different
in the functions and strength
Now let's take a closer look
Function and strength of reporting verbs
Reporting verbs differ in terms of their strength
for example
"to suggest" is much weaker
and more tentative  than "to argue"
The two verbs convey very different pictures
about how the author you are studying sees
his or her materials and research
Some reporting verbs
are used principally to say
what the writer does and does not do
These verbs do not indicate
any value judgement on the part of the writer
they are called 'neutral' reporting verbs
A second group of verbs is used to show
when the writer has
an inclination to believe something
but still wishes to be hesitant
we call these 'tentative' reporting verbs
Finally
if the writer has
strong arguments to put forward
and is absolutely sure of his or her ground
we can use "strong" reporting verbs
to refer to these ideas
In the table
the main reporting verbs
in English are classified
in terms of their function
and their strength
Read and remember
In addition
some verbs can fit more than one category
e.g. warns can be used to disagree with
emphasize or examine an idea
Some verbs are followed by a preposition
e.g. as  to for with  of
while others are followed by a noun or ‘that’
It is important you understand
and know how to use the verb correctly
before placing it in a sentence
and that you use past or present tense
as appropriate
Now Let's do an exercise
Use these verbs in the spaces below
Here is an example
Lee   that problems arose
earlier than previously thought
What should we put in the space
There is a clue in the following bracket
says directly
Says directly  that is to declare
to assert  to state
The answer is “States”
So the complete sentence is
Lee  states that problems arose earlier than
previously thought
Now finish the other sentences in three minutes
Now let's check
Schmidt   discusses that
the process of language acquisition
is important in childhood
Davidson  emphasizes
that previous research in the field
is important in understanding the concept
NASA argues
that governments should continue to
fund space projects
In the latest article  Morton explains
how information technology
is changing society
Kim  and Young note how Bach's music
draws considerably
on earlier composer's work
Uvarov claims that
the causes of the revolution
can be traced back to the 18th century
Vaz  and Jonas reject the new theory
because it fails to include important factors
Kon  and Miller  suggest
that all poets are strongly influenced
by their childhood
Levack points out that
there are contradictions in Day's interpretation
of the poem
Gerrand questions previous interpretations
of the play
11. In the book
Dean mentions some new researchin the field
McIntosh and Johnson  conclude
the key features of the period in question

Hello  everyone
Today we'll continue
to explore the literature review writing
Tense is one of the most important language features
in writing a satisfactory LR
Let's see what tenses
are most commonly used in the LR section
The present simple  or present perfect
are generally used
to introduce the literature review
let's  look the sentence
SIn the literature
there are several examples of new strategies
to perform these tests
which all entail setting new parameters
SMany different approaches
have been proposed to solve this issue
Use the present perfect to refer to
ongoing situations
i.e. when authors are still investigating
ongoing situations
i.e. when authors are still investigating
a particular field
Even though specific past dates are mentioned
these dates are part of a series of dates
that describe situations
that researchers are still working on today
and will continue in the future
This means that past simple cannot be used
in any of these three cases
S  Since
there have been many attempts
to establish an index
but until now no one has managed
to  solve the issue of …
S As yet  a solution to Y
has not been found
although three attempts have been made
SSo far researchers have only found
innovative ways to solve X  but not Y
In S3–Snote the underlined words
These are adverbials of time
that are typically used
with the present perfect
because they indicate something that
began in the past
i.e. when research first began in this area
and continues into the present
They represent unfinished situations
So when do we use the past simple tense
You must use the past simple when
The year of publication is stated
within the main sentence
not just in brackets
You mention specific pieces of research
e.g. you talk about initial approaches and methods
that have subsequently probably been abandoned
You state the exact date
when something was written or proved
In S6–Swe are talking about
completely finished actions
so the present perfect cannot be used
SThe first approaches used
a manual registration of cardiac images
using anatomical mark- ers
defined by an expert operator along
all images in the temporal sequence
Then in
a new method was introduced which …
S This problem was first analyzed in
S Various solutions were found
in the late 1990s
In all other cases
the simplest solution
is to follow the style of the examples
S Lindley  investigated the use of the genitive in
French and English
and his results agree with
other authors' findings  in this area
He proved that …
S Smith and Jones  developed
a new system of comparison
In their system two languages are/ were compared
from the point of view of …
They found that …
S Evans studied the differences between
Italian and English
He provides /provided an index of
He highlighted that …
In S9–Sthe first verb introduces the author
and is typically used in the past simple
Other similar verbs are  for example examine
analyze  verify  propose
design  suggest  outline
The second verb in S9–Sdescribes
what the authors found
In Sagree is logical
because Lindley's findings still agree today
with the findings in the papers referenced
at the end of the sentence
In Sand S
both past simple and present simple are possible
However
it is common to use the present simple
when describing  how a system
method procedure etc  functions
In Sthe present simple underlines that
Smith and Jones are still using their system
and that it is still valid
The use of the past simple
were compared in Swould probably imply that
Smith and Jones' system is not in use anymore
and it was just a step in this road of research
that has subsequently been  superseded
The third verb in S9–Sindicates
what the author managed to do
find  obtain  prove  demonstrate  highlight
and typically such verbs
are used in the past simple
found  obtained etc
Again however
some authors use the present simple
in such cases
Use the present simple to discuss
previously published laws  theorems
definitions  proofs  lemmas
Such published work is generally considered
to be established knowledge
and the use of the present simple reflects this
SThe theorem states  that
the highest degree of separation
is achieved when …
S The lemma asserts that
for any given strategy of Player
there is a corresponding …
In summary  present simple
present perfect and past simple tenses
are the most used ones in writing
a literature review
Wish you every success in your writing
Thank you
