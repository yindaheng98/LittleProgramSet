﻿ Hello  everyone Welcome again to our academic writing course In this unit we will study knowledge and skills about drafting the Discussion and Conclusion  setions in a journal article And our study will be carried out under five main topics with subtopics for each just as listed in the following slides We as authors may be very concerned about the structure of the Discussion section of a journal article but wait a second before we eagerly ask the question how should I arrange my Discussion section we need to make clear that the structure of this section has a lot to do with its unique function and its relationship with other sections of the article So here we need to pay much attention to these two key points function and relationship in order to have a better understanding of how we should draft the Discussion section in the proper way Moving into this stage of the article writing we may have now sufficiently in our hands the results findings or data concerning the study it is now  time to demonstrate our own critical thinking capabilities of analyzing and interpreting Here are some questions to help us prepare our Discussion in terms of its function and relationship with other sections .

﻿ It differs from the Abstract and Introduction as it is for a more informed reader In fact you are making a summary for readers who hopefully have read the rest of the paper and thus should already have a strong sense of your key concepts Unlike the Abstract and Introduction the Conclusions section The Conclusions section is not just a summary Don't merely repeat what you said in the Abstract and Introduction It is generally not more than one or two paragraphs long A Conclusions section typically incorporates one or more of the  following Thank you for watching see you in the next part .

﻿ Causes and effects focus on why things happen and what their results or consequences are Causes are the reasons why something happened they answer the question Why did the event happen The causes of a car accident might be bad weather conditions inattention on the driver's part  or faulty brakes Causes occur before the event and make the event happen Effects are the direct results or consequences of an event they respond to the question What happened because of the event The effects of a car accident might be injury litigation  or increased insurance premiums Effects come after the event and are the direct results of the event The study of causes and effects is central to many disciplines For example historians analyze causes and effects of historical events What were the causes of the Civil War What were the results of the Treaty of Versailles Scientists attempt to unravel causes and effects as well What causes cancer cells to multiply in the body What effect do they have on healthy cells What effect does shade have on plant growth What are the effects of destroying tropical jungles overfishing  pollution or dams on the salmon population If our focus of study is on causes effects or both we need to clearly and accurately announce them in our thesis statements Now look at the following statements and see whether they are well-designed thesis statements for causes or effects Obviously  they are well-written statements However  as thesis statements demonstrating causes or effects they need to be more explicitly drafted just like the following Examine each cause or effect to determine whether it is a direct cause or effect of your event If you can discuss the cause or effect without having to discuss any other causes or effects then more than likely it is a direct cause For example the direct causes of your car accident might be the slick road the bad condition of your brakes or your slow reaction to the car stopping in front of you Indirect causes might be the lack of funds that led to your not getting your brakes fixed and the fact that you stayed up all night writing a paper You may wish to discuss secondary or indirect causes in your paper but do not present them as direct or primary causes If there are numerous causes or effects to discuss group them into related categories political economic  social physical  emotional Just because something happened before an event does not mean it caused the event to happen Similarly just because something happened after an event does not mean it is a result or consequence of the event Thank you for watching see you in the next part .

﻿ Before we start today's topic paraphrasing I would like to tell you a story about a graduate student of my university At my university  students have to submit their dissertation for plagiarism detection before they have the defense If the detection report says overlap rate exceeds 25% it means over 25% of the dissertation is copied from papers in the databases of the detection system which is the evidence of plagiarism If the dissertation is proved plagiarism it would be disastrous for the students as the degree might be disqualified The graduate student I would like to talk about had an overall overlap rate was 8% which was ok  but the overlap rate of the literature review was 35% which was reported as "plagiarism" The student was very upset and confused He insisted he did not plagiarize because he wrote down the source of the ideas he borrowed and listed the citation in the reference as well What is happening here is that any overlap of more than words from a single source or over consecutive words in any sentence will be regarded as plagiarism in CNKI detection system   for instance And  turnitin  the detection system  used in the UK is stricter than CNKI So remember you can borrow the ideas but not the language A good way to avoid unintentional plagiarism is  to paraphrase what you want to cite Paraphrasing means to restate the idea in your own words But how can we paraphrase There are basically two levels of paraphrasing One is lexical using words with a similar meaning or the same words with  different forms to replace the original words The other is syntactic i.e. to change the sentence structure As we can see we can use synonyms or make a word form change at the lexical level "Relieve" can be replaced by "ease" we can use "early in " to replace in the beginning And synonyms of "disease" are condition disorder  and illness we can use any one of these words to paraphrase At the syntactic level a negative sentence can be transformed into a positive one and vice versa Like "The symptoms were alleviated" we can rewrite it like this The symptoms were not exacerbated We can also change the subject For example"Symptoms may improve" The new sentence would be There may be an improvement in the symptoms The active voice can be changed into the passive one and vice versa For example The lotion can sooth the itching The new sentence would be The itching can be soothed by the lotion Reorganizing word order is another good way to change the structure For instance In the beginning the drug had adverse side effects The new sentence is There were adverse side effects early in the cycle But the best way is to combine the two types of transformation together Here is an example The product of the cycle is two daughter cells which have been created from the original cell This is the original sentence The result of the cycle is the creation of two daughter cells from the original cell It's the paraphrased version The subject of the original sentence "product" is replaced by a synonym "result" The verb "create" is replaced by the noun form"creation" While for the most part the blue part is totally copied from the original Though the author has made some changes it is still plagiarism I'll show you the right way to paraphrase in the following example The original sentence is The temperature in many parts of the world is gradually rising You can replace "many parts of the world" with lots of places around the earth which is the same meaning Also replace "gradually" with "slowly" and "rising" with"increasing" It's good to have lexical changes but pure lexical change is not enough You can consider structure change as well The subject "temperature" can be changed into many parts of the world which makes the sentence look very different But we still have consecutive words exactly the same as the original So it would be much better if we combine the two levels of changes together As you can see "Lots of places" is the lexical change also replaced the original subject "temperature" Then the new sentence is Lots of places around the earth are getting hotter steadily It's exactly the same meaning but different language Let's summarize We can borrow the ideas of other people but not their language A good way to borrow others' idea is to paraphrase the authors to improve academic originality and avoid unintentional plagiarism Thank you for watching

﻿ In the Conclusion section we need to restate our thesis with our own reflection involved In this  we should keep the restatement strong and never weak But how to achieve this Next we will discuss together points first what a strong thesis statement is like and second and more importantly kinds of weak thesis statements and how we can fix them Now  as a conclusion to our unit let's briefly summarise the five topics we have discussed again And here our thanks and acknowledgemet go sincerely to those authors whose publication gave us great inspiration for the design of this program Many times our plan developed by following your excellent points and examples With admiration and respect we have listed your names and original writings in the next slides Thank you very much for your help And  thank you  my students for sharing with us this program Thank you for watching We hope that this program marks a rewarding footprint on your road to your success .
