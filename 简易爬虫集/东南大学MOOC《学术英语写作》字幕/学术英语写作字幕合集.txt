People use different languages
in different settings for different purposes
If you are a student
the language you use to chat with your girlfriend
is very likely to be different
from the text message
you send to your teacher
yo sup       Readin
What ya readin' bout
Dear professor Adams
I 'm texting you to ask for a sick leave
for your class of next week
I was just diagnosed as having flu
which is contagious
Can I have your PowerPoint to make it up
Thank you very much for your understanding
Yours truly   James
You see the difference  In this class
we are going to talk about language register
What is register
What are the different registers in English
What are the linguistic features of
academic register And finally
we ll have a little practice
Language register is a style of speaking and writing
depending on the audience
purpose topic and location
It also represents a level of language formality
in spoken and written languages
There are languages registers in English
Static  or frozen
formal  or regulated
consultative
also called professional and academic
casual  in other words group register
the last register is personal or intimate
Static or frozen language does not change
For example  the U.S. constitution wedding oath
class pledge
Formal language
is a one-way communication and impersonal
Interruptions are not allowed
For example
class lectures  speeches announcements
Consultative or professional or academic language
is a formal conversation
focused on providing information
For example
that used between employee and boss
or student and teacher
Causal language is informal
It uses slang and idioms
It's considered "group language "
because you have to be a part of
the accepted group to use this language
e.g.  you will hear it between friends
or read it in text messages
"Yo  sup " or "Nah" "LOL"
are all casual language
teenagers are experts at casual language
Intimate language
is for private conversation
in a close relationship
e.g. a parent and a child
siblings or boyfriend and girlfriend
The language we use in academic writing
is mainly formal language
But what are the differences between
informal and formal English
Let's have a look
at two different registers of passages for
and think about
what features make the language formal
This is register
Here we are  register
You may find it pretty difficult
to understand the second style of writing
because there are some features of
formal register
which make the writing quite different
than the first passage
First these vocabulary words in red
are medical terms
You may need background knowledge
to understand them
The orange words represent present tense
because the passage comes
from a medical textbook
and states some facts
The pink ones represent a passive voice
which is very frequently seen
in academic register
because there is no need to
tell who the agent or the doer is
but just state how things are done
The purple word DIC
disseminated intravascular coagulation
is an acronym
which is very likely to be known
only within the medical field
The green words are nominalization
which means verbs are transformed
into nouns to increase the formality level
The brown word "it" is a third person pronouns
In academic writing
third person pronouns
or a non-person subjects
are very frequently used to
create a sense of  objectivity
You will note that
the sentences in passage
are longer and more complex
than in the first passage
Let's have a little practice
Please rewrite the following sentence
in formal language
Usually
you won't get hurt if you don't fool around
"Won't" is a contraction
"fool around" is an idiomatic phrase
"get hurt" is informal
We can change these words
to make the sentence  more academic
"Usually" is replaced by "in most cases"
the second person pronoun is replaced
with a third person
individual  he or she
"Get hurt" is changed to "be injured"
"fool around" to "careful"
We change all casual words to formal ones
So the sentence is In most cases
an individual will not be injured
when he or she is careful
To wrap up
formations or characteristics
of academic register include
wording terminology  hyponyms and acronym
nominalization  third person pronouns
the  statement impersonalized
the passive voice and present tense
in statement of facts
its  well important to remember
that form reading of  Higher structural complexity
than that in general English
Thank you

Hi good morning everyone
Today we are going to talk about
how to write a title for an academic paper
First of all
Let's have a look at these titles
Would you read the papers judging from the titles
Or are these titles attractive enough
to invite you
to spend minutes or more
to go through the main body
Probably not
Why not   First
these four titles are all too general
we have no idea what they are about
Second
let's look at the first one
"the U.S.constitution"sounds a little boring
unless politics is your specialty
"The history of the tennis ball"
is a little trivial
and it is hard to develop it into a 10-page essay
"Life of U.S. president Kennedy"
is very likely to be based on single resource
a biography  for example
And "death penalty" is an overused topic
that has been written on too much already
So these titles are not what we want
The above are just examples of bad titles
When you choose your topic
Do remember to avoid the above types of topics
The first type of topic
you should avoid is a topic
that has too wide a scope
If you check your OPAC system at the library
or search the topic online
and find that lots of books
and articles have been written about your topic
then it is probably too big
A topic with too wide a scope
is not researchable
The second type
that should be avoided is one
that is too trivial
People sometimes go to the extremities
Just like too big a topic
too trivial a topic
is not researchable either
Sometimes the topic is trivial  because it is obvious
like "walking is a good aerobic exercise"
The safest way is to ask your tutor about it
The third type of topic
that should be avoided is
that based on a single resource
The research paper is intended to
expose you to different opinions of different people
If the topic is mainly based on one resource
you are defeating the purpose of the paper
If you d like to write
about the life of a famous person
it is very likely that you
will over-rely on a single resource
The fourth type of title that should be avoided
is the type that has been overused
There are some topics
that we are very familiar with
so that it is relatively hard to
produce something new
These topics are abortion
teenage marriage substance abuse
global warming the death penalty
if you have to write about an overused topic
try to approach it
from a new angle to produce sth new
and to distinguish yourself
from the familiar cliché
We have learnt what bad titles look like
then  what makes a good title
There are several principles to observe
which can be simplified as SCI
It is not what we know about
the publication level
i.e.  "Science Citation Index"
Here S stands for specific
which means the title cannot be
too broad or general
Because too general a topic
is not researchable
For example
"bilingualism" is too big
to be covered in an essay of pages
and you can develop over
or smaller researchable topics
as undergraduate students
C stands for concise
It means a title preferably contains
as few words as possible
usually in noun phrases
So try to be concise and short
"I" stands for "informative"
It means the title should
contain all key words of
the research objective
In this way
the title can provide adequate information
about the research
and the readers can make a quick decision
whether they would read the whole paper
just at the sight of the title
If some key words are missing
or some non-key words appear in the title
it would be misleading
It would be a frustrating
experience for readers to
find the essay is not what it looks like
So all in all
a good title should be specific
concise and informative
This is what we called an "SCI" title
Let's have a little practice to
test ourselves on what we have learnt
Here we have two groups of titles
Decide which is an "SCI"  title
The first group
An investigation of mast cell functioning
The role of mast cells in inflammation
We know that mast cells have many functions
They play a role in inflammation
in allergy and in cancer
so it can be narrowed down
to a specific disease
which can make sure
the essay is limited to a reasonable length
Obviously  the second one is
much more specific than the first one
Let's see the second group
Major California labor laws
and their impact on Mexican migrant workers
California migrant workers
"California migrant workers" is shorter
but is pretty big
If you would like to write about a specific person
or a group of people
usually they have many aspects to write about
like their political aspect
their economic aspect
their education their marriage life and etc
Please just choose one
Here the author of title narrowed
the migrant worker to Mexicans
He is a law student and relates the topic
to his specialty
So the first one is much more specific
We already know what an SCI title is but
how can we write an S.C.I. title on our own
Here I'd like to provide you a
"3-step" method to write your own title
The first step is to choose a topic
Pick a topic you really like
are curious about
or are an expert on
You are like a traveller
who is choosing where to go
If it's some place you like
you'll enjoy getting there
But if it turns out to be
somewhere you don't like
getting there would be a misery for you
So make sure this topic is interesting to you
The second step is to narrow the topic down
to a researchable one
by adding some determiners or modifiers
to the topic word you have chosen
Remember  the more determiners you have
the more specific the title is
A reasonably specific title should be
covered in about pages
Step is paraphrasing
Usually your narrowed down topic is a viewpoint
a statement or a research question
try to paraphrase whatever you have
into a noun phrase of less than words
You may know a lot of essay titles
which are not noun phrases but
noun phrases are the safest option
for beginner writers
When you choose your topic
it could be a contemporary one
like fighting obesity in children and teenagers
or how modern online slang affects society
The topic can also be a more historical one
like the effect of religion on American politics
how English is used in advertising in china
Now let's test ourselves
on the 3- step method to write a title
You are interested in china
But china is as big as it is
What can we do about it
You have to narrow it down
by adding some determiners
Here we are
Chinese agriculture is more specific than china
But it is not enough
You can further narrow it down
by adding a time period
and relate it to your specialty
say politics
Here we are
The effect on China of its agricultural policies
during the past years
is a good option
Here is another example
Anxiety is a heated issue nowadays
drawing attention of many psychologists and educators
But it is also too big
What can we do
Right
Add a determiner to the word
Then we have student anxiety
Obviously  we have sth more to do
We can further narrow it down by limiting anxiety
to some aspects of the issue
and by specifying the research population
Here we go
The major types and levels of anxiety
of the graduate students of Southeast University
is absolutely an SCI title
In summary  we have learned
what a good title should be like
and a 3-step method to write your own title
I hope you can write a perfect title
for your essay after watching this video
Thank you for watching
Have a nice day

Hello  In this short video
we are going to
talk about nominalization
a very important technique
in academic writing
Here are the main items covered in this video
What is nominalization
Why do we have to use it
And how do we use it
What is nominalization
Nominalization is the process of converting verbs
or adjectives in a sentence to nouns
The purposes of nominalization are to
Increase information density
and facilitate efficiency and
accuracy of communication
Express abstract concepts
e.g.  revolution possibility
Hide the agent behind an action
Improve flow of writing
maintain connections between ideas
Make writing more "written" and professional
But how to nominalize a sentence
First Write a simple sentence
Then choose an appropriate ending
to create a nominalized form
for the main verb or adjective
Next find a second verb to be the main verb
The last step is to fill in the sentence
with additional information
So the nominalization formula
can be illustrated in the following flow chart
Here is an example to show the
steps of nominalization
Princess Shotoko admired china
Can you transform this sentence
into another one with nominalizations
First  we choose the only verb admire
nominalize it to be a subject
And add an appropriate suffix
to turn it into admiration
Then the sentence becomes a noun phrase
Admiration of china
Next  a new verb should be added
Here we take "bring" as a verb
The last step is
to fill in the rest of the information
Here we are
Admiration of china brought religious
and scholarly ideas to Japan
in the 7th century
Let's have a little practice
Please rewrite the following sentence
with nominalizations
If we contain the problem
we can reduce the effect
Here we choose two verbs
contain and reduce
and transform them with appropriate suffixes
into nouns
So  "Contain the problem " becomes
the containment of the problem
"Reduce the effect " is changed
to a reduction of the effect
Then we need to find a new verb
to connect the two ideas
This sentence would be like this
The containment of the problems
will lead to a reduction of the effect
To wrap up
Nominalization is to convert
verbs/adjectives to nouns
Nominalization is an important technique
for academic writing
We learnt a 4-step procedure
to transform an informal sentence
into a formal/academic one
Thank you

If you want to persuade others
your language must be strong and clear
When you state your opinions
you want to refer to the evidence
instead of what you think
The correct choice of personal pronouns
will improve the creditability
and professionality of your statement
and help you achieve these communicative goals
Hello today we are going to talk about
personal pronouns and academic writing
This mini-lecture will be divided into parts
First  we'll have a little review about
all personal pronouns in English
And then why  we need to avoid first
and second person pronouns
Next How to avoid first
and second person pronouns
Before we finish for the day
we will clarify  some confusions
If we look at the table horizontally
we can see first
second and third person pronouns
And if we look at it vertically
we can see the middle column
is singular form and the right plural form
Formal and academic writing needs to be impersonal
as statements of opinions in a paper
are supposed to be independent of
individual perspective
And an academic essay should be scientific
and sound distanced
Such first and second person pronouns
as "I" and "you" are not objective
so generally they should be avoided
But we cannot say "I" and "we" should be
totally avoided because
different disciplines have different tolerances
for the first person pronoun
In some disciplines  the use of "I"
is perceived as being too personal
However  people are more tolerant
of such uses in other disciplines
So you should be aware of the preference
of the discipline  you are in
In general
such third person pronouns as  "it" and "they"
sound more objective and convincing
so it's safer to use third person pronouns
in academic writing
But how can we avoid using first person pronouns
in a sentence
Here are some examples
I  think that the results show
In my opinion the results show
I  believe that the results show
In these sentences
the author is announcing their findings
But as we all know
any opinion or finding without a reference
in the paper is the author's
so there is no need
to make the announcement
that it's the authors findings
In this case
I think  in my opinion and I believe
can just be deleted
without harming the function of these sentences
The second way to avoid first person pronouns
is to change the active voice
to the passive voice
For example
In this paper
we developed a feasible transmission schedule
If "we" is deleted
there would be no agent
so the passive voice is the best choice
Then the sentence would be
In this paper
a feasible transmission schedule was developed
Let's have a little practice
The original sentence is
As I observed the communication styles of
first-year Carolina women
I noticed frequent use of non-verbal cues
The writer is
stating the finding of his observation
frequent use of non-verbal cue
so just state it
"I observed" is the research approach
You want to highlight
the finding instead of the approach
So the original sentence could be revised to
A study of the communication styles of
first-year Carolina women
revealed frequent use of non-verbal cues
We can see avoiding the first person
creates the desired impression
of an observed phenomenon
that could be reproduced
and also creates a stronger clearer statement
Let's come to the second person pronoun
Remember  do not use second person
in the paper unless you give instructions
Here are some examples of revisions
It is important that you examine
could be revised to
It is important to examine
You should examine
this could be an imperative sentence
Examine    you can just change a subject
like...
The user should examine
You can see from the results in figure
This sentence  describes the findings
in the figure
So just state what is presented in the figure
As shown in figure
or use passive voice like
As can be seen in figure
Compared with the first and second person
the third person sounds credible
assertive and professional
So they're widely used in
creative and academic writing
There 's one thing
I have to remind you
That is  when you use the third person
please use gender fair language
First  avoid automatic use of masculine pronouns
such as "he" and "his"
when referring to a singular noun
for example    A student will do better
if he has a voice in the decision
It would be fairer to say
A student will do better
if he or she has a voice in the decision
But too much "He or she" will sound redundant
so the plural form may be a better option
E.g. students will do better
if they have a voice in the decision
There is another example I'd like to clarify
Here is the sentence pattern
It has been found that
It was found that
are very frequently used in an essay
But the problem is
who has found it is unclear
I suggest
if it is the finding of several studies
just write "several studies have found that"
If it's found by one study
you can write "Kroll found that "
if the information is from your study
you can say "we found that "
I found that
If it's not acceptable
to use the first person in your field
you can use the code word
this study   the current study
the present study  this author
In summary
first and second person pronouns sound
personal and subjective
Third person pronouns are academic and professional

Words are the most basic element
in how we communicate
and yet
most of us don't spend much
time thinking about the words we choose
We often use the first word that comes to mind
In academic writing
careless word choice
may not effectively expresses our idea
Since words are the tools we use
to communicate our ideas and experiences
it's important to choose the best words
Now we will try to focus on some of the issues
surrounding word choice

Now you need to write a literature review
Whether this is a class assignment
a thesis for your masters' degree
or the foundation
for your doctoral dissertation
you are doing it for the same reason
to lay a solid foundation by
critically reviewing previous work and
find a space to develop your own research
Doing this right can largely increase your skills
knowledge and expertise in this field
Hello  I'm  Doctor Wu
There are known
procedures and skills you can use
to make your task easier
and more efficient
In this online class
we'll provide you a roadmap
to produce a literature review
that will contribute to your field
We'll talk about three questions
What is a Literature Review
Are there different types of it
How do we review literature
Now let's start with the question
What is a Literature Review
A literature review
is a careful examination of a body of literature
pointing toward the answer
to your research question
It provides the context
and the background
about the current knowledge of the topic
and establishes a convincing thesis
to answer the study's question
So what is not a literature review
A literature review is not just
an annotated bibliography
a book report or a "data dump"
where you simply gather
all of the information you have acquired
and randomly or awkwardly transfer it
to paper without rhyme or reason
It is an argument
that presents a case
based on a comprehensive understanding
of the current state of knowledge
about a topic of study
Thus it's necessary to
include a critical analysis of the different opinions
from credible sources and point out
how they are related to your own thesis statement
Are there different types of literature review
Yes  There are simple and complex models
A simple literature review gathers
documents analyses
and draws conclusions
about what is known of the topic
Its purpose is to produce a proposition
that reflects the current understanding
about the research question
A simple literature review begins by
Selecting and identifying
a research interest for inquiry
This is called the preliminary study question
As you proceed
you narrow and refine this interest
into a research topic
based on an initial exploration of the literature
The research topic is a clear and concise statement
that defines and describes
what will be researched
Its definition identifies and
frames the scope of the literature review
The literature review discusses the literature
documenting and cataloguing pertinent knowledge
From this information
it presents an evidence-based analysis
of the present understanding of the topic
The product of the simple literature review
is the development of a case
that argues what is known about the topic
The case's conclusion
the thesis statement
answers the question posed
by the research interest
Many class research assignments
and master's degree thesis projects
require a simple literature review
A complex literature review on the other hand
has a different purpose
and additional demands
It not only presents the current
state of knowledge about a topic
but it also argues
how this knowledge reasonably leads
to a problem
or to a question requiring original research
It is often adopted
when you need to write
your doctoral dissertation or
publish your work in prestigious journals
Before writing a literature review
you have to first review
the relevant research papers and books
How do we do that
Doing  a Literature Review is scholarly exerise
employing an applied critical thinking process
Doing  a Literature Review is scholarly exerise
employing an applied critical thinking process
Conducting a literature review is developmental
with each of the six steps leading to the next
Here is a brief explanation of these six steps
A successful research topic
usually begins with a compelling interest
about a problem
whether it comes from the field
or from previous research
This topic must be stated
as a well-defined question
accessible  to a specific academic discipline
When the interest is field-based
refinements most likely must be made
to form it into a well-defined question
That interest must be translated from
everyday language into the concepts
and wording
that define a researchable topic
Three steps are taken to reach this transformation
Specifying the language
refining the focus of the interest
and selecting the academic vantage point
To argue your thesis successfully
you first need to present your case
To present your case
you also need to organize the relevant data
into a body of evidence
that explains what is known about the topic
A literature search determines
what information will be in the review
It does this by sifting the information
to only the data
that provides the strongest evidence
to support the thesis
When searching the literature
you must preview  select
and organize the data for study
Use the skills of skimming
scanning and mapping the data
The literature survey assembles
synthesizes and analyzes the data to
form the argument
about the current knowledge on the topic
The evidence creates a logical
and defensible set of conclusions or claims
These conclusions
provide the basis
for addressing the research question
The literature critique interprets
the current understanding of the topic
It analyzes how previous knowledge
answers  the research question
Thesis writing transforms the research project
into a written document
Through composing  molding  and refining
the written literature review
becomes a work
that accurately conveys the research
and that can be understood
by the intended audience
Thesis writing requires
writing auditing  and editing
Repeated editing creates the polished
final composition
Sounds a little daunting
Here are a few tips for you
Study carefully the literature review models
Choose one that suits you
Memorize it if possible
Use this flow chart to keep yourself on track
Collect evaluate and select literature
A good literature review should be an
effective evaluation of selected documents
on a research topic
A good literature review should be an
effective evaluation of selected documents
on a research topic
Start writing now  As you read
you should also begin the writing process
—take notes
that you can later incorporate into the text
of your literature review
It is important to keep track of your sources
with citations to avoid plagiarism
Find connections and themes
To begin organizing your literature  review's
argument and structure
you need to identify relationships
between the sources you've read
Based on your reading and notes
you can look for trends
patterns conflicts or gaps
Well  that's all for Today's class
In the next class
we'll talk about
how to structure a literature review

Hi  everyone
Today we'll continue with Literature review
In the previous session
we've discussed
what is a literature review
and how to review literature
now it's time to learn how to write it
In this session
we shall analyze the structures
and explore the techniques of writing a good one
We'll talk about three questions
What should we include in a literature review
How can we organize these ideas
Are there any techniques that can be helpful
First question
What should we include in a Literature Review
Literature review is often at the very beginning
or the introduction part of a research paper
It can be written as a stand-alone section
or provide a theoretical framework
and rational for a research study
as part of the introduction section
A Literature Review
generally answers the following questions
and generally in the following order
You can use the answers to these questions
to structure your Literature Review
What are the seminal works on my topic
Do I need to mention these
What progress has been made
since these seminal works
What are the most relevant recent works
What is the best order to mention these works
What are the achievements
and limitations of these recent works
What gap do these limitations reveal
How does my work intend to fill this gap
Second question
How should we organize these ideas
There are various approaches
to organizing  the body of a literature review
You should have a rough idea
of your strategy before you start writing
Depending on the length of your literature review
you can combine several of these strategies
for example
your overall structure might be thematic
but each theme is discussed chronologically
Chronological
The simplest approach
is to trace the development
of the topic over time
However  if you choose this strategy
be careful to avoid simply listing
and summarizing sources in order
Try to analyze patterns
turning points and key debates
that have shaped the direction of the field
Give your interpretation of
how and why certain developments occurred
Thematic
If you have found some recurring central themes
you can organize your literature review
into subsections
that address different aspects of the topic
For example
if you are reviewing literature about
inequalities in migrant health outcomes
key themes might include
healthcare policy language barriers...
cultural attitudes  legal status  and economic access
Methodological
If you draw your sources
from different disciplines or fields
that use a variety of research methods
you might want to
compare the results and conclusions
that emerge from different approaches
For example
Look at what results have emerged
in qualitative versus  quantitative research
Discuss how the topic has been approached
by empirical versus theoretical scholarship
Divide the literature into sociological
historical and cultural sources
Theoretical
A literature review is often the foundation
for a theoretical framework
You can use it to discuss various theories
models and definitions of key concepts
You might argue for the relevance
of a specific theoretical approach
or combine various theoretical concepts
to create a framework for your research
Are there any techniques we can employ
How can we lead readers
to our own research
Here is an extract from the Introduction
to a paper entitled
The Effects of Feedback
and Attribution Style on Task Persistence
where a psychology student
Chris begins his review of the literature
Read the passage for minutes and find out
what are included in these paragraphs
Now let's look at the first paraph
The first sentence
of the first paragraph introduces
the main topic
cultural differences
and the rest of the paragraph briefly reviews
a major study on this topic
The implications of this study
culture as the remaining variable
are summarized at the end of the paragraph
The first sentence of the second paragraph
then moves on to the next
in chronological terms
major study
Chris summarizes Heine's work in a way that
involves the reader
he uses the verb speculated
and then continues the next sentence
using if
which gives an example of this speculation
The first sentence of the third paragraph
summarizes the findings
of the first two paragraphs
in order to introduce some more recent findings
Note also his use of tenses
In his first sentence
which is a very general overview
he uses the present perfect
Then when he talks about
the work of specific authors
and makes a summary of each step
in the chronology of the literature
he uses the past simple
Chris's structure is thus
introduction to topic
support from the literature
mini summary
introduction to next topic
This technique works very well
because it tells a story
it is a logical build up
to the reason behind Chris's investigation
that readers can easily follow
Chris has gradually prepared his readers
for the focus of his work
his own personal hypothesis regarding persistence
Ok  today we've talked about
what should be included in our review writing
how should we organize them
and a few techniques we could employ in writing

Hi everyone
Today we are going to talk about
the issues of plagiarism
and how to avoid it
Plagiarism is rightly
an important issue
in the academic world and beyond
It is basically "academic theft"
of words or ideas
an unethical practice
which can have very serious consequences
Here is what we are about to elaborate
Firstly we'll discuss
what is plagiarism
and different types of plagiarism
Then we'll proceed to find out
how to avoid it by citing properly
There are different citation styles
and methods in citing
Last but not the least
strategies for citing will also be explored
So  first
what is plagiarism according to
different sources
It is defined as
the copying or paraphrasing of
other people's work or ideas
into your own work
without full acknowledgement
the act of representing
as one's own original work
the creative works of another
without appropriate acknowledgment
of the author or source
the "wrongful appropriation" and
"stealing and publication" of another author's
language thoughts ideas or expressions
and the representation of them
as one's own original work
In a word
if no credit is given to the original source
even if you've made minor modifications
it could still be considered as plagiarism
Now let's decide whether the following cases
are examples of plagiarism
If you go through the four-step process
for paraphrasing
you would first translate the words
then flip the sentence structure
add a signal phrase and then cite
Therefore to avoid plagiarism
and conform to academic ethics
you need to check for plagiarism
before submitting your paper
provide reference to
every citation you make
and write in your own words
Using your own words
is especially important
when you cite other's work
Here are three techniques
you may employ when citing
When referring to the work of others you might
paraphrase  i.e. explain something
with roughly the same amount of detail
summarise  i.e. convey the main ideas of a passage
chapter article or book in fewer words
quote  i.e. use somebody else's exact words
relatively infrequent in scientiﬁc texts
though sometimes useful
especially for precise deﬁnitions
It is important to know
which technique is appropriate
It is also important to make sure that
the work you produce in this way
reﬂects your own understanding
and analysis of the subject
and of the sources you have consulted
Quoting is to repeat in speech
or writing the words of another person
esp. a powerful or important person
usu. with acknowledgement of the source
It is used when
language is particularly vivid or expressive
exact wording is needed for technical accuracy
the words of an important authority lend weight
to an argument
Paraphrasing
is to express the meaning of a word phrase
or passage in other words
usu. with the object of fuller
and clearer exposition so as to bring out the sense
We could change the original sentences
in both the lexical and syntactic level
Use synonyms
Change word forms
Make necessary structural adjustments
Change between
the affirmative and the negative
Change the voice from active to passive
Change clauses to phrases
Include reference to the original source
Summarizing is to put in your own words
a shortened version of written
or spoken material
stating the main points
and leaving out anything
that is not essential
Summarizing involves analyzing information
distinguishing important elements from
unimportant elements
and transforming large chunks of information
into a few short cohesive sentences
You can start by reading a short text
and highlight the main points
as you read
Reread the text
and make notes of the main points
leaving out examples  evidence  etc
Restate or repeat the ideas of the source
in different words and phrases
Do not add your own ideas
opinions or judgment of the arguments
Make it shorter than the source
We'll further explain them later
in the following classes
Thank you for watching

Reporting verbs
In academic writing
you will often need to refer
to the research of others
also called secondary sources
A reporting verb is a word
which is used to talk about
or report on other people's work
Reporting verbs can be used to great effect
but the difficulty with using them is that
there are many
and each of them has a slightly different
and often subtle meaning
In academic writing
it is important to present
an argument logically and cohesively
You may be required to
comment on someone's work
agree or disagree with someone else's study
evaluate someone's ideas
Often you will be assessed
on your ability to demonstrate these skills
It is repetitive and boring
to write ‘Smith says...’ over and over again
Fortunately
there is a wide choice
of reporting verbs in English
Reporting verbs can indicate either
(a) the author's personal viewpoint
(b) the author's viewpoint
regarding other literature
(c) your viewpoint regarding
what the author says
To interpret the writer's ideas
accurately however
you will need to use a verb
with the correct nuance
Use an English learner's dictionary to check
that you have the right verb
for the right context
Let's look at the following examples
Kon suggests that
all poets are strongly influenced
by their childhood
Patel  argues  that
governments should continue to
fund space projects
Greenberg claims   asserts contends
maintains  declares
that the causes of the revolution
can be traced back to the 18th century
You may notice that
these reporting verbs are different
in the functions and strength
Now let's take a closer look
Function and strength of reporting verbs
Reporting verbs differ in terms of their strength
for example
"to suggest" is much weaker
and more tentative  than "to argue"
The two verbs convey very different pictures
about how the author you are studying sees
his or her materials and research
Some reporting verbs
are used principally to say
what the writer does and does not do
These verbs do not indicate
any value judgement on the part of the writer
they are called 'neutral' reporting verbs
A second group of verbs is used to show
when the writer has
an inclination to believe something
but still wishes to be hesitant
we call these 'tentative' reporting verbs
Finally
if the writer has
strong arguments to put forward
and is absolutely sure of his or her ground
we can use "strong" reporting verbs
to refer to these ideas
In the table
the main reporting verbs
in English are classified
in terms of their function
and their strength
Read and remember
In addition
some verbs can fit more than one category
e.g. warns can be used to disagree with
emphasize or examine an idea
Some verbs are followed by a preposition
e.g. as  to for with  of
while others are followed by a noun or ‘that’
It is important you understand
and know how to use the verb correctly
before placing it in a sentence
and that you use past or present tense
as appropriate
Now Let's do an exercise
Use these verbs in the spaces below
Here is an example
Lee   that problems arose
earlier than previously thought
What should we put in the space
There is a clue in the following bracket
says directly
Says directly  that is to declare
to assert  to state
The answer is “States”
So the complete sentence is
Lee  states that problems arose earlier than
previously thought
Now finish the other sentences in three minutes
Now let's check
Schmidt   discusses that
the process of language acquisition
is important in childhood
Davidson  emphasizes
that previous research in the field
is important in understanding the concept
NASA argues
that governments should continue to
fund space projects
In the latest article  Morton explains
how information technology
is changing society
Kim  and Young note how Bach's music
draws considerably
on earlier composer's work
Uvarov claims that
the causes of the revolution
can be traced back to the 18th century
Vaz  and Jonas reject the new theory
because it fails to include important factors
Kon  and Miller  suggest
that all poets are strongly influenced
by their childhood
Levack points out that
there are contradictions in Day's interpretation
of the poem
Gerrand questions previous interpretations
of the play
11. In the book
Dean mentions some new researchin the field
McIntosh and Johnson  conclude
the key features of the period in question

Hello  everyone
Today we'll continue
to explore the literature review writing
Tense is one of the most important language features
in writing a satisfactory LR
Let's see what tenses
are most commonly used in the LR section
The present simple  or present perfect
are generally used
to introduce the literature review
let's  look the sentence
SIn the literature
there are several examples of new strategies
to perform these tests
which all entail setting new parameters
SMany different approaches
have been proposed to solve this issue
Use the present perfect to refer to
ongoing situations
i.e. when authors are still investigating
ongoing situations
i.e. when authors are still investigating
a particular field
Even though specific past dates are mentioned
these dates are part of a series of dates
that describe situations
that researchers are still working on today
and will continue in the future
This means that past simple cannot be used
in any of these three cases
S  Since
there have been many attempts
to establish an index
but until now no one has managed
to  solve the issue of …
S As yet  a solution to Y
has not been found
although three attempts have been made
SSo far researchers have only found
innovative ways to solve X  but not Y
In S3–Snote the underlined words
These are adverbials of time
that are typically used
with the present perfect
because they indicate something that
began in the past
i.e. when research first began in this area
and continues into the present
They represent unfinished situations
So when do we use the past simple tense
You must use the past simple when
The year of publication is stated
within the main sentence
not just in brackets
You mention specific pieces of research
e.g. you talk about initial approaches and methods
that have subsequently probably been abandoned
You state the exact date
when something was written or proved
In S6–Swe are talking about
completely finished actions
so the present perfect cannot be used
SThe first approaches used
a manual registration of cardiac images
using anatomical mark- ers
defined by an expert operator along
all images in the temporal sequence
Then in
a new method was introduced which …
S This problem was first analyzed in
S Various solutions were found
in the late 1990s
In all other cases
the simplest solution
is to follow the style of the examples
S Lindley  investigated the use of the genitive in
French and English
and his results agree with
other authors' findings  in this area
He proved that …
S Smith and Jones  developed
a new system of comparison
In their system two languages are/ were compared
from the point of view of …
They found that …
S Evans studied the differences between
Italian and English
He provides /provided an index of
He highlighted that …
In S9–Sthe first verb introduces the author
and is typically used in the past simple
Other similar verbs are  for example examine
analyze  verify  propose
design  suggest  outline
The second verb in S9–Sdescribes
what the authors found
In Sagree is logical
because Lindley's findings still agree today
with the findings in the papers referenced
at the end of the sentence
In Sand S
both past simple and present simple are possible
However
it is common to use the present simple
when describing  how a system
method procedure etc  functions
In Sthe present simple underlines that
Smith and Jones are still using their system
and that it is still valid
The use of the past simple
were compared in Swould probably imply that
Smith and Jones' system is not in use anymore
and it was just a step in this road of research
that has subsequently been  superseded
The third verb in S9–Sindicates
what the author managed to do
find  obtain  prove  demonstrate  highlight
and typically such verbs
are used in the past simple
found  obtained etc
Again however
some authors use the present simple
in such cases
Use the present simple to discuss
previously published laws  theorems
definitions  proofs  lemmas
Such published work is generally considered
to be established knowledge
and the use of the present simple reflects this
SThe theorem states  that
the highest degree of separation
is achieved when …
S The lemma asserts that
for any given strategy of Player
there is a corresponding …
In summary  present simple
present perfect and past simple tenses
are the most used ones in writing
a literature review
Wish you every success in your writing
Thank you

Hello  everyone
After reviewing the literature
the author will provide the information
about the methods applied in the current research
and the results obtained
from different experiments or surveys
But how do we write the method section
and how do we report the results
Now I'll explain them one by one
Hi  everyone
Can you tell me which section
is the most important section
in a research paper
Yes  it is the method section
Now let me tell you why
and then talk about some points
as to the writing of this section
In a research paper
the method section is considered
the most important section
because it provides the information by which
the validity and credibility of a study
can ultimately be judged
Therefore  the researcher must provide
a clear and precise description
of how an experiment was carried out
and the rationale for the specific
experimental procedures chosen
The following aspects are related
to the writing of the method section
In natural sciences
the method section is often called
Materials and Methods
In social science
it is common to introduce a section called
Theory and Methods
Sometimes  it is divided into two sections
Theoretical Framework and Methods
Generally speaking
the method section mainly describes the steps
that you followed in conducting your study
and the materials you used in each step
The elements included in the method section
and the order in which they are presented
may differ from department to department
Here we would like to introduce some elements
which are typical and representative in most disciplines
Overview of the experiment
When you overview the experiment
you need to  use one sentence
briefly telling what was done
The sentence is like a topic sentence
Population
The population refers to the people
subjects studied
or the things tested in the study
Location
In the method section
you should mention the place
where the study took place
Restriction or Limiting conditions
Restriction or Limiting conditions
refer to the precautions taken to make sure
that the data are valid
Sampling Techniques
Here you should describe
how the subjects or participants
were selected for the study
Materials
Also  the materials
which were used to conduct the study
or experiment should be described
Procedures
Of course
it is very important
to state the procedures
or the steps of the experiment
in a chronological order
Statistical Treatment
And at last
you need to describe
how the statistics were examined
It is worth noticing that
not all the items are included in all disciplines
because various disciplines have
various procedures or regulations
In some disciplines
the method section is called
the Methodology Section
When the author uses "Methodology"
as the title of the section
he or she needs to provide the rationales
for how the experiment was
designed and  conducted
for the current study
The rationales refer to the fundamental reasons
or principles of doing things
In such a case
the author should offer some reasons
for designing or conducting the experiments or surveys
For example
the reasons for such questions as
why did the author choose such participants
and "Why did the study follow such procedures "
should be offered
If the researcher conducted his/her experiments
by following the methods used by others
he/she should acknowledge
those authors/researchers
in order to avoid plagiarism
In this sense
the author should be very familiar with
the theories and principles of
designing and conducting experiments
At the same time
the author needs to avoid plagiarism
by referencing well
Since the method section is very important
we need to pay more attention
to the major elements and use of language
when we write this section
Thanks for watching

In the previous lecture
I mentioned the importance of the method section
Actually
the results section is also important
because it presents the answers
to the research questions
which the readers are curious about
Now  I'd like to talk about some points
which should be stressed
when you write the results section
When you report the results
the following elements may be included
The statement showing where the results can be found
The statement presenting the most important findings
The statement commenting on the results
this may include
The generalisation from the results
The possible explanations
of the possible reasons for the results
The comparison of the results
with what was expected
or with results from other studies
These elements can be found
in the results section
in most journal papers
The results section is usually presented
both in diagrams and texts
No matter how professional the diagrams are
the texts are the most important way
to present the results
So authors need to use very academic
and smooth language to report the results
compare the data and make
explanations and comments
When reporting the results
the author should decide
how to order the results
The order should be in accordance
with the order of the research questions
or research methods
The arrangement of the order
should abide by
the normal practice of the target journal
or the specific discipline
The language focus of the results section will include
how to use sequential markers
how to describe the graphs
and how to compare and contrast
which will be explained in the lectures followed
When you write the results section
you need to pay attention to the major elements
the presentation of the results
the order of the results and language focus
But if you want to write this section well
you still need to read more journal papers
about the structure of this section

Sequence markers in English writing
are a certain group of items
that link sentences together
into a larger unit of discourse
These linguistic items go by various names
such as conjuncts
sentence adverbials
connectives
linking devices
transitional words and phrases
But why do we use sequential markers
and what are the commonly used sequential markers
Let me show you the answers
in this micro lecture
Sequential markers
can help establish clear connections between ideas
and ensure that sentences and paragraphs
flow together smoothly
making them easier to read
In writing the method section
the author needs to describe the procedures
very clearly and logically
In such a situation
the author prefers to write process paragraphs
to explain how to do things
and how something works
These process paragraphs are usually
developed step by step
in a chronological or logical sequence
The following sequential expressions
are more frequently used to link steps
in a description of a process
or to divide a process into steps
Here is a paragraph in which
the author uses various sequential markers
From the example we can see
this paragraph is naturally and cohesively presented
because the author uses various sequential markers
in describing the procedures flexibly
Actually sequential markers
can appear in any part of a research paper
especially in the method section
where you need to provide the information
about the procedures
of conducting the study
With the help of sequential markers
you can make your papers
more logical and coherent
I hope you could use the sequential markers
correctly and properly in your writing
Thanks for watching

Hi everyone
Can you think of any devices
which can present the results more vivid
Right  you can use graphs
Graphs are commonly used in reporting
the results of your research
A graph is a diagram
usually a line or a curve
which shows how two or more sets of numbers
and measurements are related
Graphs usually include bar charts
pie charts line graphs and so on
Graphs usually include bar charts
pie charts line graphs and so on
The results section is usually presented
both in graph and text
First  prepare the graphs
as soon as all the data are analyzed
and arrange them in the sequence
that best presents
your results in a logical way
Then as the results section
is a text-based section
the description of graphs
is of great importance in paper writing
Good descriptions
can help the readers understand
your research better
while using a single sentence pattern
to describe the statistical and
graphic information in a research paper
will make your readers feel too bored
and lose interest in reading on
so we need to pay more attention to
the language used
when describing
the statistical and graphic information
The description of graphs
is of great importance in paper writing
because it can help the readers
understand your research better
How do you describe a graph
Here are the major steps
for you to follow
Step Introduce the graphic information briefly
and indicate the main trend
Normally  it includes the place
time content and purpose of the graph
Step  Describe the relevant
and most important or significant data
and make some comparison if necessary
Words and expressions
for describing a curve
or a trend are very useful
in presenting graphic information
Step  Summarize the data/trends
Here we introduce some useful words
phrases or sentence patterns
which can be used
in different situations of graphic description
If you need to highlight
significant data in a table/chart
you may use some adjectives such as apparent
clear  interesting  obvious
revealing  or  significant
to make your viewpoint known
and meanwhile to attract readers attention
For example
This micro lecture mainly
talks about the use of graphs
and the graphic description
Remember the descriptions should be
very close to the graphs you describe
and the graphs described
should be numbered
for the convenience of the readers

When you are writing the results section
you need to do much more than just give data
What you should always try to do
is to convey more information with the data
Now let me introduce a way
to deal with the data
comparison and contrast
Strictly speaking
the purpose of comparison
is to show similarities
while contrast is used to show differences
Through comparison or contrast
between two or more things
the readers can understand different things better
Here are some key words
commonly used to express comparison or contrast
There are two ways of organizing paragraphs
of comparison and contrast
One way is to examine one thing thoroughly
and then examine the other
This method is called
block comparison or block contrast
The other way is to examine two things
at the same time
discussing them point by point
This method is called
alternating comparison or alternating contrast
More examples can be obtained
by reading more sample journal papers
Comparison and contrast
is often used in graph description
Here are some points
for you to pay special attention to
Not all the information
has to be compared or contrasted with each other
It is common to introduce the most significant
or important information
and compare or contrast it
If necessary
you must make some calculation
before comparing or contrasting the data
When comparing or contrasting information
in the graphs
it is not necessary to lay equal emphasis
on every change
Just give stress to those dramatic changes
or to those that are of special interest to you
or those that you want your readers
to pay more attention to
and ignore the less important parts
The comparison and contrast should be supported
by concrete and relevant facts or data
To make the data you collected
more meaningful
you need to make comparison or contrast
So it's very good for you to
grasp the skills I introduced
in the micro lecture
Thanks for watching
This unit introduces two important sections
in an academic article
the method section and the results section
Both of them have their features
in the elements and language use
I hope this micro-lecture could help you
learn how to write these two sections
with the language focuses I introduced before
Thanks for watching
