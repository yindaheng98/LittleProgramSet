Hello everyone
Plagiarism occurs
not just when you directly copy words
from others' work
By the way
you can use some websites
to form your reference list
CNKI and Web of Science
are good examples
You only need to select your sources
and click the button Export of literature
and you will get the reference list
It is convenient and time-saving
To meet the target journal's requirement
of a reference list
you just need a slight change
Choosing an authoritative expert
and an authoritative journal
in a related field
to refer to
is quite safe and preferable
when citing other's work
Except old but typical books or articles
your references should be of the latest study
to convince your readers
A paper is condensed life
while life is an extended paper
When writing a paper
you have to learn what has been done before
to find out the problem
and try to come up with some new methods or findings
At the end of the paper
you can leave something valuable
for future researchers
Just like your life experience
learn create
and leave some valuable things for others
also attaches great importance to one's integrity
If we reference in this way
the chances of our paper being read will increase
After class
please do the corresponding exercises

Hello everyone
sometimes only one or two sentences
In fact
it is unnecessary
for a paper to have  acknowledgements
unless it has its special requirement
It is good manners
when writing a paper or a dissertation
After class
please do the corresponding exercises
These are our references
That's the end of today's class
Thanks for your attention

Now I believe you have finished your
very first journal paper
congratulations
The next step in your research work
is to submit your paper
to a suitable journal online
But before submitting
you will have to prepare a cover letter
or "letter to the editor"
or just "editor letter"
because you will be required to submit this letter
when you go through the submission process
In this video
we are going to talk about
Why do we have to
write a convincing cover letter
and What to write in this letter
Why do we need to write a strong cover letter
Because this is the first impression of your paper
and it may help the editor- in- chief
to make a decision
if your paper can be published
It's a good opportunity for the authors
to highlight the merit
and significance of their research
Also it gives the editor a reason to
read it further
and send it to the peer reviewers
If your research cannot interest the editor
it cannot interest the readers either
What should be included in the cover letter
The first tip I give you
is to follow the author guide of your target journal
Failure to meet the requirements
will lead to automatic rejection
I'm sure you don't want that to happen
The second tip is to include essential information
The editor's name  journal name   manuscript title
article type
Is it a review case report or original study
submission date  if applicable
brief research background and research question
brief statement of methodology
major findings and significance
how your study will benefit the research field
all contacts of the corresponding author
and prior /current publishing status
What should be avoided in the cover letter
Don't use too much jargon and acronyms
Don't exaggerate
Exaggerating  your study results
may lead to the editors questioning your ability
to objectively assess the study
Don't make it lengthy
The letter is
only meant to be an introduction of your paper
Keep it to one page or less
Don't try to be entertaining
Try to keep a professional tone
instead of an entertaining one
Here is a sample cover letter
On the left side of the screen is a sample letter
On the right is the information you need to input
The sentence in blue is the template language
you can directly use in your own cover letter
The first part of the letter
is the address or letter head
Remember an email cover letter
is a little different
from a PDF one or a hard copy
You don't need this part in an email cover letter
James Joyce is the name of the editor
you are sending the letter to
Usually you should include
their degree after the name
most editors have a Ph.D. degree
Then  the position at the journal
James Joyce is the editor- in- chief
followed by the journal name
International Science Journal
a hypothetical journal
journal's address
and submission date
Let's start simply
dear Dr. Joyce
I don't recommend Mr. Ms. or Mrs.
because for many Chinese people
sometimes we cannot tell the gender or
the marital status from English names
It's very easy to find editors' job titles
and degrees on their website
and Dr. is the safest title with
which to address the editor
In the first paragraph
you need to introduce your paper
You should include your paper title
journal title  paper type
one to two sentences
that "pitch" your study
your major findings and conclusion
Again on the left side
you can use the template language
regardless of the contents of your study
"I am writing to submit our manuscript entitled" blabla
is why you are writing this letter
Ling Huchong and Qiaofeng are the author names
State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics
School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering
Southeast University  Nanjing China
is their institution
It is submitted to be considered for publication
as an International Science Journal "Original Article"
Here International Science Journal is the journal name
and Original Article is the paper type
Then followed by an overview of your study
We developed a novel filling material
is the major achievement in the study
outperformed GIC and PC
in tests of chemical composition
physical properties and cytotoxicity
is the methodology and conclusion
In paragraph
you will need to state the purpose of the study
and the contribution that
it will bring to this journal
It includes research background and study gap
the reader profile of this particular journal
the name of the journal
and you want to discuss achievements  of
previous research
and its knowledge gap
Let's have a look at our example
Given that there are still controversies
in the clinical application value of a  b and c
This is the background
We believe that
the findings presented in the paper
will appeal to dentists and
end-filling material developers
They are the potential readers
who subscribe to International Science Journal
this is your target journal
So the first sentence is
talking about the contribution this paper may
bring to the target journal
Although prior studies
have identified a few radiopaque agents
that could be used in clinic
This is the achievement of the previous studies
they have been cost-prohibitive
and difficult to administer on a national level
They are the limitations
Thus our findings will allow your readers to understand
chemical composition
physical properties and cytotoxicity
of the agents we compared
This is the selling point of the present study
In doing so
we hope that
our research provides more options
for dentists in clinical practice
You are telling the editor
your purpose of the study
is in line with the goal and scope of their journal
In the next paragraph
we should give a "conflict of interest statement"
saying there is no conflict of interest
approval from all authors to submit the paper
and it's the only journal
we are submitting the paper to
We can use the whole paragraph
as the template language in our own letter
No conflict of interest exits
in the submission of this manuscript
and the manuscript is approved by all authors
for publication
I would like to declare on behalf of my co-authors
that the work described
was original research
that has not been published previously
and not under consideration
for publication elsewhere
in whole or in part
Usually  authors have the right
to recommend peer referees
to review their paper or not to review it
Please do use your right
otherwise your paper might be sent
to the wrong hands
But who your paper will be finally sent to
is up to the editors
In paragraph
you can also copy and paste the template
Should you select our manuscript for peer review
we would like to suggest
the following potential reviewers or referees
because they would have
the requisite background
to evaluate our findings
and interpretations objectively
Then list the name
institution email and expertise
After the list
you can include further information of
conflict of interests
Additionally
to the best of our knowledge
none of the above-suggested persons have
any conflict of interest
financial or otherwise
This is also important
to let the editors know
they don't have any financial
legal or ethical conflict of interest
In paragraph
you should mention the frequently requested
additional information
If you require any additional information
regarding our manuscript or any queries
please don't hesitate to
contact me at the address below
It is also a good way to close your letter
Don't forget politeness
and to thank the editors
Thank you for your time and consideration
Yours sincerely Dr. Ling Huchong
This is the name of the first author
After that
list all contacts of the corresponding author
Let's summarize what we have learnt
First  the cover letter is very important
because it gives the editor
the first impression of your paper
and may influence their decision
Second you can use
the 5-paragraph template cover letter
provided in this video
as it contains all the necessary components.
You can even directly use
the template language in blue
Thank you for watching
